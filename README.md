Sell Goods: Sellers can list their products for sale on the platform. 

Buy Goods: Shoppers can browse through various stores and purchase items using cryptocurrency.

Fill Out Shipping Information: Once a seller receives an order from a buyer, they can enter the shipping details, including the tracking number, to inform the buyer of the status of their shipment. This allows buyers to track their orders and ensures that they receive their purchases in a timely manner. 

Confirm Receipt Information: Once the products have been received, the buyer or seller can confirm the transaction, ensuring that the payment is released to the seller.

Refunds: If the seller has not shipped the product yet, the buyer can request a refund through the platform. The platform's smart contract will ensure that the buyer receives a refund.

Returns:  Buyers can initiate a return through the platform if they receive a defective or incorrect product, and the platform's smart contract will start the return process.

Settle Transactions: Once the buyer confirms the receipt of the products and the transaction is completed, the seller can settle the payment and receive the funds in their account. The platform's smart contract ensures that all transactions are processed quickly and securely.

More features are currently under development to enhance the platform's functionality and provide an even better user experience.
